      CodeBattles is an online platform for solving simple programming
      exercises in a real-time competitive environment. The idea is to
      have people engage in friendly contests agains friends or unknown to
      have fun and improve their programming skills.

    <h4>More about CodeBattles.</h4>

    <p>
      CodeBattles was made at <a href="http://shiftappens.com">Shift
      APPens</a>, a hackathon organized in Portugal where 50
      participants took part to make an app in 48 hours. CodeBattles
      was made by David Gomes, Pedro Paredes and Andr√© Baptista.

    <h4>How does it work?</h4>

    <p>
      The idea is that you join rooms to play games of 5 rounds
      (around 2 minutes each) and are then ranked on how fast you can
      solve the problems. For now, you can use both Python 2 and 3,
      but we intend to add support for other languages in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      All you have to do to start playing is sign up for an account
      and you can then pick any room to start playing!
